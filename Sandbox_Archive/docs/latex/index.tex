Provides application and engine developers a simpler method to access Open\+XR runtimes (e.\+g. Steam\+VR, Oculus, W\+MR, Monado, etc) without having to wade through the intricacies of directly using the raw Open\+XR Loader library.

{\bfseries{I. Pre-\/built binaries}}

You can find pre-\/built library files (.lib, .dll) as well as a Open\+GL Sandbox application (.exe) for quick testing in the {\ttfamily bin} directory. This requires Steam\+VR Beta 1.\+16

As a quick Open\+XR lifecycle demo, the Sandbox app renders a skyblue clear color to the swapchain images which then gets rendered to the hmd by the active Open\+XR runtime. Sandbox also blits (copies) this texture to the desktop window (XR Mirror).

Detailed logs in the console and {\ttfamily bin/logs} directory could be of particular interest to developers looking to see the Open\+XR api calls being made by the library

{\bfseries{II. Building Pre-\/requisites}}

Visual Studio 2019 with C++ modules C\+Make 3.\+14.\+4 and above

{\bfseries{I\+II. Building}}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone or copy the repository from Git\+Hub
\item From the root directory of the repository, create a build directory ({\ttfamily mkdir build})
\item Go to the build directory ({\ttfamily cd build})
\item Run C\+Make ({\ttfamily cmake ..}) A {\itshape openxr\+\_\+provider.\+sln} file is generated in the build directory which you can then open and use in Visual Studio 2019
\item Optional\+: Build the library and Sandbox application in C\+Make ({\ttfamily cmake -\/-\/build .})
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Note\+: Currently supports Windows x64, Open\+GL 3.\+2 and above
