Provides application and engine developers a simpler method to access Open\+XR runtimes (e.\+g. Steam\+VR, Oculus, W\+MR, Monado, etc) without having to wade through the intricacies of directly using the raw Open\+XR Loader library.

A general overview and introduction to this library can be found here\+: \href{https://medium.com/p/6824989613b9}{\texttt{ https\+://medium.\+com/p/6824989613b9}}

Open\+XR Provider Library developer documentation (generated via Doxygen) can be found here\+: github.\+com

Sandbox developer documentation (generated via Doxygen) that can be used to quickly test the library can be found here\+: github.\+com

{\bfseries{I. Pre-\/built binaries}} You can find pre-\/built library files as well as a Sandbox application (.exe) file for testing in the {\ttfamily bin} directory

{\bfseries{II. Building Pre-\/requisites}} Visual Studio 2019 with C++ modules C\+Make 3.\+14.\+4 and above

{\bfseries{I\+II. Building}}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone or copy the repository from Git\+Hub
\item From the root directory of the repository, create a build directory ({\ttfamily mkdir build})
\item Go to the build directory ({\ttfamily cd build})
\item Run C\+Make ({\ttfamily cmake ..}) A {\itshape openxr\+\_\+provider.\+sln} file is generated in the build directory which you can then open and use in Visual Studio 2019
\item Optional\+: Build the library and Sandbox application in C\+Make ({\ttfamily cmake -\/-\/build .})
